#Steps to build the Highcharts Server application for Java#
###Prerequisites###

The java based Highcharts export-server has the following prerequisites:
- installed an application server (for example: Apache Tomcat, Jboss, TC server, jetty for development)
- installed Java 1.6 or later
- installed Maven 2 or later
- installed Phantom on the server, <a href="https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/blob/master/exporting-server/phantomjs/readme.md">see here</a>

###Configuration###
- Edit the app.properties file in <a href="https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/blob/master/exporting-server/java/highcharts-export/src/main/resources/app.properties">highcharts-export/src/main/resources/app.properties</a> and change the properties. Read the comments in the property file, for deciding what you need to change.

You can change the location of the phantom executable, the convert script, timouts and poolsize

###Building a .war file###
Now you have configured the application, such that it's resembles your specific environment, you can compile the project files. Browse to the Highchart-Export folder and while standing here type the following in a terminal: <ul style="list-style-type:none"><li><pre>mvn clean package</pre></li></ul>
After compiling you will find a highcharts-export.war residing in the target folder. Upload/copy this to the application server.

###Testing###
We supplied the <a hre="http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/">Jetty Server</a> dependency in pom.xml file. For running the export-server locally during development or testing, fire the command:
    mvn jetty:run
The application is then accessible at http://localhost:8080/highcharts-export.

###Good to know###
- Change you url property for the exporting option in your (javascript) highcharts options configuration, and point it to the new installed exporting-server.

    <pre><code>exporting:{
        url:'http://new.server.com/highcharts-export'
    }</code></pre>

- Remeber to install necessary fonts on the server. Install them on the server, The application will pick them up after installation.
